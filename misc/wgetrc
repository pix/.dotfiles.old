# Experimental (not fully-functional) support
# for "Content-Disposition" headers. 
#
# This can currently result in extra round-trips 
# to the server for a "HEAD" request, and is known to suffer 
# from a few bugs. This option is useful for some 
# file-downloading CGI programs that use "Content-Disposition" 
# headers to describe what the name of a downloaded file 
# should be.
